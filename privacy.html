        <article>
          <p>AAEON Technology Inc. understands users have concerns about who and where their personal information might be used and shared with. Therefore, we take these concerns very seriously and want users be clear on how we are using their information and the ways in which uses can protect such.</p>

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We collect information to provide better service to all of our users such as setting up a user account, personal profile, contacts, special requests, etc.. In order fulfill these services, we may share certain portions of personal information with third parties.</p>
          <h3>We Collect Information in 3 Ways:</h3>

          <h4>Information Users Give Us</h4>
          <p>Many of our services require users to sign up for a registration. Therefore, we collect Personal Information such as name, company name, email address and telephone number. If users want to take full advantage of the features we offer. We may also ask users to provide certain information for the service. We will automatically receive and record certain information from your browser when users interact with our service. Some collected information may not be personal, depending on the nature of the service.</p>
          <h4>Information Collected and Shared</h4>
          <p>When we collect usage information, we only use data in aggregate form, but not to identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data enables us to know how often customers use portions of our service, so we can make the service eye-catching to as many customers as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners to give them a clear picture of how often our users utilize services. In this instance, we can provide our users with an optimum online experience. However, we will never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
          <h4>Communication Channels</h4>
          <p>We may contact users by email or other means, for example, to send promotional offers on behalf of other business or communicate with users about use of our service. If users do not wish to receive any emails, they can indicate their preference in their account settings or email us at <a href='mailto:sales@aaeon.com'>sales@aaeon.com</a></p>
          <p>When users choose to use out invitation service to invite a friend to the service, we will ask for invitee’s email address and send an e-mail invitation automatically. We will store this information when your invitation is accepted and to track the success of our invitation service. However, the user’s friend may still contact us and this information be removed from our database at sales@aaeon.com.</p>


          <h2>How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We use the information collect to provide, maintain, protect, improve, and develop new service. We will neither sell nor rent your personal information to anyone.</p>
          <h3>We only share personal information listed in the personally identifiable form with third parties described below:</h3>

          <h4>Affiliated Business (not controlled by AAEON)</h4>
          <p>In certain situations, our affiliated businesses may sell items or provide services to users (either by themselves or jointly with us). For example, when we sell products or provide services jointly with affiliated businesses, users will recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service. We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain AAEON services.</p>
          <h4>Advertisers</h4>
          <p>We may allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and provide information we have collected from users to an advertiser in a non-personally-identifiable form. This allows the advertiser to select the appropriate audience for its advertisements.</p>
          <h4>Agents</h4>
          <p>When we employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, we will need to share user information with them to provide products or services. However, unless we tell users differently, out agents do not have the right to use any personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. For example, it users were to engage in a credit card transaction, we would need to allow the credit card processing company to verify the transaction; however, that company would only be authorized to use user’s credit card information to the extent we needed their assistance in completing the transaction.</p>
          <h4>User Profiles and Submissions</h4>
          <p>We cannot control what other users do with content voluntarily disclosed by users. For example, we will share video content with users via the service, but we cannot control if other users allowed to access to make submissions publicly available to be collected and used by others or to be redistributed through the internet and other media channels.</p>
          <h4>Protection of AAEON and Others</h4>
          <p>We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements or protect the rights, property, or safety of AAEON, our employees, users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
          <h4>With Your Consent</h4>
          <p>With exceptions noted above, we will share your personal information with third parties when we have your consent to do so.</p>


          <h2>Information Security</h2>
          <p>User’s account is protected by a password for user’s privacy and security. However, in order to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information, it is important to select and protect your password appropriately and limit access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
          <p>We strive to protect the privacy of user’s account and personal information we have in our records, however, complete security cannot be guaranteed. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure and other factors may still compromise the security of user information, at any time.</p>
          <p>We are not responsible for the privacy policies for other links the service contains. When following a link to another site, users should read that site’s Privacy Policy thoroughly.</p>
